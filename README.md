## Question 1

Given this class that represents a giant:

```swift
class Giant {
 var name: String = "Fred"
 var weight: Double = 340.0
 let homePlanet: String = "Earth"
}

let fred = Giant()
```
Answer

Will these three lines of code run? If not, why not?

```swift
fred.name = "Brick"
fred.weight = 999.2
fred.homePlanet = "Mars"
```

Fix the class definition for `Giant` in the space below so that it **does** work:


## Question 2

Take a look at this struct that represents an alien:

```swift
struct Alien {
 var name: String
 var height: Double
 var homePlanet: String
}
let bilbo = Alien(name: "Bilbo", height: 1.67, homePlanet: "Venus")
```

Will these three lines of code run? If so, why not?

```swift
bilbo.name = "Jake"
bilbo.height = 1.42
bilbo.homePlanet = "Saturn"
```

Change the declaration of `bilbo` so that the above three lines of code **do** work:


## Question 3

Consider this bit of code that uses the `Giant` class:

```swift
let edgar = Giant()
edgar.name = "edgar"
let jason = edgar
jason.name = "Jason"
```

What will the value of `edgar.name` be after those three lines of code are run? What will the value of `jason.name` be? Why?


## Question 4

Given this bit of code that uses the `Alien` struct:

```swift
var charles = Alien(name: "Charles", height: 2.25, homePlanet: "Pluto")
var charlesFromJupiter = charles
charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet = "Jupiter"
```

What will the value of `charles.homePlanet` be after the above code run? What about the value of `charlesFromJupiter.homePlanet`? Why?


## Question 5

Here's a struct that represents a bank account:

```swift
struct BankAccount {
 var owner: String
 var balance: Double

 func deposit(_ amount: Double) {
 balance += amount
 }

 func withdraw(_ amount: Double) {
 balance -= amount
 }
}
```

Does this code work? Why or why not?

Fix the `BankAccount` struct so it does work.

Given the code below (which should incorporate any fixes you made):

```swift
var joeAccount = BankAccount(owner: "Joe", balance: 100.0)
var joeOtherAccount = joeAccount
joeAccount.withdraw(50.0)
```

What will the value of `joeAccount.balance` be after the above code runs? What about the value of `joeOtherAccount.balance`? Why?


## Question 6

a. Write a struct called `Person` that has 3 properties of type `String`: a first name, a last name and a middle name. Have the middle name be optional. Create 2 instances of a `Person`, one with a middle name and one without. Print one of their first names.


b. Write a method in `Person` called `fullName` that will return a formatted string of an instance's full name. Call this method on both the instances you created in part a.


## Question 7

a. Create a struct called `Book` that has properties `title`, `author` and `rating`, of type `String`, `String`, and `Double` respectively. Create some instances of `Book`.


b. Add a method to `Book` called `isGood` that returns `true` if its rating is greater than or equal to 7


## Question 8

```swift
class Dog {

}
```

Work through the following tasks one by one, in order. Each time, add to the `Dog` class above. Each task has sample output that you should be able to replicate when you are done.

a. Give `Dog` four properties, all with default values: `name (string), breed (string), mood (string), and hungry (boolean)`.

```swift
var dog1 = Dog()
dog1.name //returns "dog"
dog1.breed //returns "unknown"
dog1.mood //returns "calm"
dog1.hungry //returns false
```

b. Add an instance method called `playFetch()`. It should set the dog's `hungry` property to `true`, set its mood property to `playful`, and print "Ruff!"

```swift
var dog2 = Dog()
dog2.name = "Rhett"
dog2.breed = "English Setter"
dog2.mood = "excited"
dog2.hungry = false

dog2.playFetch() //prints "Ruff!"
dog2.hungry //returns true
dog2.mood //returns "playful"
```

c. Add an instance method called `feed()`. If the dog is hungry, it should set `hungry` to `false` and print "Woof!" If the dog is not hungry, it should print "The dog doesn't look hungry"

```swift
var dog3 = Dog()
dog3.name = "Partner"
dog3.breed = "Golden Retriever"
dog3.mood = "thoughtful"
dog3.hungry = true

dog3.feed() //prints "Woof!"
dog3.hungry //returns false
```

d. Add an instance method called `toString` that returns a `String` type description of the dog:

```swift
var dog4 = Dog()
dog4.name = "Rascal"
dog4.breed = "Golden Retriever"
dog4.mood = "feeling pawesome"
dog4.hungry = true
print(dog4.toString())
//prints:
//Name: Rascal
//Breed: Golden Retriever
//Mood: feeling pawesome
```

e. Add a type property called `count` that keeps track of how many dogs have been created so far.

//Ex: There have been four dogs created so far
`Dog.count //returns 4`


## Question 9

There are three common scales that are used to measure temperature: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin:

C = (F - 32) / 1.8
F = 1.8 * C + 32
K = C + 273

a. Make a struct called `FreezingPoint` that has three static properties: `celsius`, `fahrenheit`, and `kelvin`. Give them all values equal to the freezing point of water.


b. Make a struct called `Celsius` that has one property: `celsius`, and two methods `getFahrenheitTemp`, and `getKelvinTemp`. Make the values of `fahrenheit` and `kelvin` correct values, converted from the `celsius` property.

```swift
var tenDegreesCelsius = Celsius(celsius: 10.0)
tenDegreesCelsius.celsius //returns 10.0
tenDegreesCelsius.getKelvinTemp() //returns 283.0
tenDegreesCelsius.getFahrenheitTemp() //returns 50.0
```

c. Give the `Celsius` struct a method called `isBelowFreezing` that returns a `Bool` (true if the temperature is below freezing).


## Question 10

Create a struct called `RGBColor` that has 3 properties, `red`, `green`, `blue` that are all of type `Double`.

Given the below array of color dictionaries, create an array of `RGBColor`.

```swift
let colorDictArray: [[String: Double]] = [["red": 1.0, "green": 0.0, "blue": 0.0],
 ["red": 0.0, "green": 1.0, "blue": 0.0],
 ["red": 0.0, "green": 0.0, "blue": 1.0],
 ["red": 0.6, "green": 0.9, "blue": 0.0],
 ["red": 0.2, "green": 0.2, "blue": 0.5],
 ["red": 0.5, "green": 0.1, "blue": 0.9],]
```


## Question 11

a. Create a struct called `Movie` that has properties for `name` (`String`), `year` (`Int`), `genre` (`String`), `cast` (`[String]`), and `description` (`String`). Create an instance of your `Movie` class

b. Create an instance method inside `Movie` called `blurb` that returns a formatted string describing the movie.

Ex: "Borat came out in 2006. It was an odd film starring Sacha Baron Cohen as a man named Borat who was visiting America from Kazakhstan."


## Question 12

Create a function outside of your `Movie` struct called `makeMovie` that takes in a dictionary of type `[String: Any]`, like `dieHardDict` below, and returns an `optional Movie`. Use `dieHardDict` to create an instance of a `Movie`.

```swift
let dieHardDict: [String: Any] = ["name": "Die Hard",
 "year" : 1987,
 "genre": "action",
 "cast": ["Bruce Willis", "Alan Rickman"],
 "description": "John Mclain saves the day!"]
```

Hint: To use a value type `Any`, you will need to cast it to its expected type.

Below, `nameAsAny` is of type `Any` because thats the type of the value in the dictionary:

```swift
if let nameAsAny = dieHardDict["name"] {
 print(nameAsAny)
}
```

Below, `nameAsString` is of type `String` because the optional binding is attempting to cast it as a `String`.

```swift
if let nameAsString = dieHardDict["name"] as? String {
 print(nameAsString)
}
```

If the binding fails it returns `nil`. `1987` cannot be cast as a `String` because it is a number.

```swift
if let yearAsString = dieHardDict["year"] as? String {
 print(yearAsString)
} else {
 print("this didn't work")
}
```

## Question 13

Given the below array of movie dictionaries, use your function from the last question to create a `Array` of `Movie`.

```swift
// movies is an Array of Dictionaries
// each element of movies is a Dictionary with the keys
// 'name','year', 'genre', 'cast' and 'description'
var movies: [[String:Any]] = [
